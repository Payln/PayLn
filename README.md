## PayLN Frontend

This repository houses the frontend for the PayLN service, a payment service for the Lightning Network and Bitcoin, developed during the Build for Africa Hackathon. Built with SvelteKit, it offers a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving payments using these innovative technologies.

## Development

### Prerequisites

To contribute to the development of PayLN Frontend, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js (version 16 or later):**  [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is a JavaScript runtime environment that provides the foundation for running SvelteKit. You can verify your installation by running `node -v` in your terminal.
- **npm (Node Package Manager):**  npm is typically bundled with Node.js installations. Check your version with `npm -v`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Payln/payln-frontend.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd payln-frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command downloads the necessary libraries and packages required to run the PayLN Frontend application.

### Running the application

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command launches the SvelteKit development server, which typically serves the application at `http://localhost:5173` by default. You can access the frontend in your web browser to start working on it.
